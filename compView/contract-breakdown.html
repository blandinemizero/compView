                This means: that I have no conflicting agreement that would prevent me from signing this agreement and that I will not violate any other agreement that I signed in the past, if any (i.e. I wont tell you any confidential information of a previous employer).

            <div class="contract-text">
                I have not made, and agree not to make, any agreement, oral or written, that is in conflict with this Agreement or my employment with the Company. I will not violate any agreement with or the rights of any third party. When acting within the scope of my employment (or otherwise on behalf of the Company), I will not use or disclose my own or any third party’s confidential information or intellectual property (collectively, “Restricted Materials”), except as expressly authorized by the Company in writing. Further, I have not retained anything containing or reflecting any confidential information of a prior employer or other third party, whether or not created by me.
